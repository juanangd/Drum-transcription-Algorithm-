# Drum Transcription algorithm

## Project pitch


* Initial idea -> Identify all the different elements in a track -> maybe it is too complicated idea so focus on the drum transcription


* Supervised learning / unsupervised learning: not sure yet/ we have seen that different groups have already implement the idea with both


* Already available datasets: but if needed we could create our own (mapping midi files into audio files using randomized samples)


* We try simple approach first and we explore with more elements


* We test against the data from other papers.


* Final goal: analysing a real audio of a drumset that we will record and try to asses the performance of our algorithm:
We record a real drummer -> the drummer provide us the midi file -> we asses the accuracy of our algorithm


## Points adressed by the professors

* Magenta(Google) datasets


## Planning for meeting 22.12.21 - 16:30


- Thilo
-> research how the data set is structure
-> Research define your own dataset
-> Read and look for more references


- Juan
-> Reading: TOWARDS MULTI-INSTRUMENT DRUM TRANSCRIPTION Paper


- Gideon
-> Reading: Unsupervised learning drum transcription algorithm


- Ivo
-> Automatic drum transcritption with CNNs / Thesis project he has found.
